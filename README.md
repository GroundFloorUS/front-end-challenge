# Groundfloor DevQuest

### Getting Started

```
brew install node && node server.js
```

### Build something cool!

Show us how much of a data nerd you are! We've supplied a single endpoint of `/` that returns a rather large data set of businesses and their locations. Use the JS front-end framework of your choice to do something clever and creative with this data.

### Tasks
Choose from one of the following development items to build, or for BONUS POINTS, come up with and build something really cool we haven't thought of yet!

* Implement an autocomplete search of business names
* Implement a feature that shows what businesses are within a given radius of a point
* Implement a business rating system

Don't worry about making things pretty! We just want to see that you've got what it takes to deliver features like the ones above, or are able to come up with your own.

Also, feel free to modify `server.js` by adding new endpoints if needed, but make sure to consume the root endpoint in some fashion.

Watch out for CORS!
